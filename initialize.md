- Decide on network id
- Keep the node consensus/protocol versions to Iris (5) because of mdw incompatibility
- Generate HC configuration - hyperchain-starter-kit
    - init (edit) -> retrieve-contracts -> gen-economy (edit) -> gen-node-conf (edit)
- Generate HC configuration - details
    - Configure parent chain
        - Configure random spend address. Technical requirement, not used as wallet.
        - Configure transaction fee and amount. Use minimum allowed amount.
        - Configure polling, keep default 500ms
        - Configure "confirmations" to 0 as it doesn't work otherwise
        - Configure "start_height" to a future - VERY IMPORTANT
    - Configure `contract_owner` with random unknown priv key address. Can be zero address, the default.
    - Decide on "genesis stakers" accounts. Generate keys/wallets.
    - Fund stakers parent chain wallets with enought tokens to keep it running. Used for parent chain commitments fees.
    - Child chain wallets are funded in the genesis accounts configuration of the child chain.
    - Create instance (factory) of StakingValidator.aes with mock/fake params/init.
    - Create instance of MainStaking.aes with real params and instance (factory) of the above.
    - Set the MainStaking instance as "reward_contract" address in the configuration.
    - Create instance of HCElection.aes with MainStaking instance as param and random entropy string
    - Set the HCElection instance address as "election_contract" in the configuration.
    - Prepare child chain genesis
        - Generate accounts.json with enought tokens funds for the stakers above
        - Generate contracts.json to bootstrap with contract creation and calls the above instances
- Add vault configuration, usualy validator and peer
- Add terraform resources
- Create terraform resources (terraform apply)
- Update seed peer static peer key in vault
- Update node configurations in vault
- Reconfigure nodes (instance restart would do)
